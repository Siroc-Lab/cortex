const TOOL_MAPPING = `
## OpenCode Runtime — Tool Mapping

You are running under OpenCode, NOT Claude Code. The following tool names are
mapped from Claude Code conventions to OpenCode equivalents:

| Claude Code Tool | OpenCode Equivalent |
|---|---|
| TodoWrite | todowrite |
| Task (subagents) | @mention syntax for dispatching subagents |
| Skill | native skill tool |
| EnterWorktree | use native git worktree commands directly |

When a skill instructs you to use a Claude Code tool name, translate it to the
corresponding OpenCode tool or workflow.
`

const EXTERNAL_DEPS = `
## External Dependencies

Skills reference external plugins. Handle them as follows under OpenCode:

- **feature-dev@claude-plugins-official**: DOES NOT EXIST under OpenCode.
  When any skill says "required: feature-dev" or tells you to invoke it,
  IGNORE that instruction. Implement the workflow directly inline.
  Do NOT search for it, do NOT try to install it, do NOT mention missing
  plugins to the user. The lack of feature-dev is normal and expected.

- **superpowers@claude-plugins-official**: Check if superpowers is installed
  via opencode.json plugins. If present, invoke its skills normally via the
  native skill tool. If absent, implement the equivalent workflow inline.

When a skill references /plugin install or /plugin reload commands, those are
Claude Code-specific plugin management commands. Under OpenCode, dependencies
are managed via opencode.json and setup.sh.
`

const CLAUDE_MD_MAPPING = `
## Project Config File

When a skill instructs you to read CLAUDE.md, also check for AGENTS.md and
opencode.json. If AGENTS.md exists, prefer it. CLAUDE.md may contain
Claude Code-specific configuration that does not apply.
`

const SKILL_PATHS = `
## Skill File Resolution

The asana-workflow plugin root is at: ${pluginsDir}

Skills live at: ${skillsDir}

When a skill instructs you to read a reference file, resolve paths as follows:

- Paths starting with \`plugins/asana-workflow/\` are relative to the
  repository root. The plugin root maps to \`${pluginsDir}/\`.
- Relative paths like \`references/xxx.md\` are relative to the current
  skill's own directory (e.g. \`.../skills/start-task/references/xxx.md\`).
- State files (checkpoints, board cache) are at: ~/.cortex/asana-workflow/

When reading a skill's reference files, use the absolute filesystem path
shown above — do NOT guess paths relative to your current working directory.

You are running the asana-workflow plugin under OpenCode.

Skills are available from the asana-workflow plugin. Use the native skill tool
to list them and load as needed. Key entry points:

- **start-task**: Orchestrates the full development lifecycle from an Asana task URL
- **ship-it**: Shipping orchestrator (PR promotion, Asana status, work summary)
- **log-task**: Create Asana tasks from conversation-discovered work

State files are stored in ~/.cortex/asana-workflow/.
