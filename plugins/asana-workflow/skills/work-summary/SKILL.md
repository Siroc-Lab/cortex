  This skill should be used when the user says "summarize my work", "what did I do", "session recap",
  "standup notes", "handoff", "write a summary", "what changed", "wrap up summary", "give me a recap",
  or "work report". Produces a concise, reusable work summary that other skills (ship-it, create-pr,

  comments without running the full ship-it flow.

# Work Summary

Generate a concise report of the current session's work — what was done, why, and what comes next. The output is designed for humans first (standups, handoffs, Slack posts) and can also be consumed by other skills that need a work summary.

## Output Format

The summary has two parts: the **body** and the **footer**.

### Body (max 3 paragraphs)

Write a natural, flowing summary — not a form with rigid sections. Use as many paragraphs as needed, up to three:

1. **What and why** — What work was done and what motivated it. Write for someone with no context. Be specific: name endpoints, components, files, configs. Mention technical details when they matter (e.g., "migrated from polling to WebSocket" not just "improved performance").

2. **Key changes** (if needed) — Expand on significant changes that deserve more detail than paragraph 1 can hold. Include architectural decisions, tradeoffs, or notable implementation details. Skip this paragraph for small or straightforward work.

3. **Blockers and next steps** (if needed) — Mention anything that blocked progress, remaining work, known issues, or follow-up tasks. Skip this paragraph when the work is fully complete with no loose ends.

Use fewer paragraphs when the work is simple. A 2-line summary for a config tweak is better than 3 padded paragraphs.

### Footer

After the body, append a **mandatory** stats line and attribution. This line is NOT optional — it MUST appear in every summary, even for trivial changes:

```
~Xh Ym | Files changed: N | Commits: N
🤖 Done
```

- **Duration** — Estimated session duration (see Duration Measurement below). ALWAYS include this, even for short sessions (`~5m` is valid).
- **Files changed** — Count of files modified/added/deleted from `git diff $BASE...HEAD --stat`
- **Commits** — Number of commits on the branch from `git log $BASE..HEAD --oneline | wc -l`
- **Attribution** — `🤖 Done` on its own line is mandatory. It signals AI-assisted work is complete and ready for review.

The stats line must follow this exact format. Do not inline file/commit counts into the body prose — they go on this dedicated line.

Do NOT include estimated cost.

## Context Gathering

To build the summary, gather data from three sources:

### Detect base branch

```bash
BASE=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|origin/||' || echo "main")
```

Use `$BASE` in all subsequent git commands.

### Git diff for scope

```bash
git diff $BASE...HEAD --stat
```

Shows which files changed and how much. Use to ground the summary in concrete file/module names.

### Git log for narrative

```bash
git log $BASE..HEAD --oneline
```

Shows commit messages that tell the story of the work — its progression and intent.

### Conversation history

Review the conversation to understand:
- What the user originally asked for and why
- Decisions made along the way
- Problems encountered and how they were solved

The conversation provides the **why** that git data alone cannot.

## Duration Measurement

Estimate session duration by combining two signals:

1. **Git timestamps** — First and last commit on the branch define the time window:
   ```bash
   git log $BASE..HEAD --format="%ai" --reverse | head -1  # session start
   git log $BASE..HEAD --format="%ai" | head -1             # most recent work
   ```

2. **Conversation turns** — Count user messages, estimate ~2-3 minutes each. This is the primary estimator.

When git timestamps span a much larger window than conversation turns suggest (e.g., overnight gap), prefer the conversation-based estimate. Format as `~Xh Ym` for sessions over an hour, `~Xm` for shorter ones. Round to nearest 5 minutes.

## Example Output

**Small change:**

```
Fixed the timezone offset bug in the session expiry check. The comparison
was using UTC timestamps against local time, causing premature logouts
for users in positive UTC offsets.

~20m | Files changed: 1 | Commits: 1
🤖 Done
```

**Larger feature:**

```
Added superadmin endpoints for listing and exporting presale code pool
codes. The pool management UI needed a way to inspect and export codes
for reconciliation with the payment provider.

New paginated endpoint GET /admin/presale-pools/:id/codes returns codes
with filtering by status. A companion /codes/export endpoint generates
CSV downloads. Both endpoints reuse the existing PresaleCodePool
repository with new query helpers for pagination and status filtering.

Next: the frontend table component needs to wire up to these endpoints.
The export button can use a direct download link since the endpoint
streams CSV.

~45m | Files changed: 3 | Commits: 2
🤖 Done
```

## Behavior

1. **Gather context** — Run git commands and review conversation history.
2. **Draft the summary** — Write the body and footer following the format above.
3. **Present to user** — Show the summary and ask if they want to adjust anything.
4. **Finalize** — Apply requested changes and return the final result.

Do not ask clarifying questions before producing the first draft — use available context to write the best summary possible, then let the user refine it. Bias toward action.

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill produces output that other skills consume:

- **ship-it** — Uses the body and stats for Asana comments.
- **create-pr** — Uses the body for the PR description.
- **asana-api** — Uses the full output as a task comment.

When called by another skill, return the structured output so the caller can extract what it needs. When called standalone, present the full formatted output directly to the user.
