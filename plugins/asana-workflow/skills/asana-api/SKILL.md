# Asana API

Common Asana REST API patterns for task management workflows. All operations use bearer token authentication via a resolved token (see Token Resolution below).

## Prerequisites

- `$ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var — primary Asana personal access token (required)
  - If missing: guide user to https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps
  - Add to `~/.zshrc`: `export ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"`
- Additional tokens (optional) — stored as `ASANA_TOKEN_<NAME>` env vars, e.g.:
  - `export ASANA_TOKEN_WORK="your-work-token"`
  - `export ASANA_TOKEN_CLIENT_X="your-client-x-token"`

## Token Resolution

At the start of every invocation, resolve which token to use and treat it as `$ASANA_TOKEN` for all subsequent API calls in this skill.

**Resolution order:**

1. **Check conversation context** — if a token override was set earlier in this session (e.g., user said "use my work account"), use that token value directly.
2. **Otherwise** — use `$ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as the default.

**Switching accounts (conversational):**

When the user says something like "use my work Asana account", "switch to the client token", or any similar intent:

1. Run `env | grep ^ASANA_TOKEN_` to discover available named tokens.
2. Match the user's phrasing conversationally against the discovered names (e.g., "work" → `ASANA_TOKEN_WORK`, "client x" → `ASANA_TOKEN_CLIENT_X`).
3. If exactly one match: set it as the active token override in conversation context. Confirm: "Switched to ASANA_TOKEN_WORK for this session." (replace `ASANA_TOKEN_WORK` with the actual matched variable name)
4. If multiple plausible matches: list the options and ask the user which to use.
5. If no match found: report clearly (e.g., "No ASANA_TOKEN_* var found matching 'work'. Available: ASANA_TOKEN_CLIENT_X") and fall back to the default.

**Error handling for the resolved token:**

- If the resolved token value is empty: report it (e.g., "ASANA_TOKEN_WORK is set but empty") and fall back to `$ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- If an API call returns 401 on the switched token: report "ASANA_TOKEN_WORK appears invalid or expired (HTTP 401)." and offer to fall back to the default.

The active token override is session-only — nothing is written to disk.

## Authentication

All requests use the token resolved above:

```
Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN
```

## Common Operations

### Fetch Task Details

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/<task-gid>?opt_fields=name,notes,assignee,assignee.name,custom_fields,custom_fields.name,custom_fields.display_value,custom_fields.enum_value,custom_fields.enum_value.name,custom_fields.type,memberships,memberships.project,memberships.project.name,memberships.section,memberships.section.name,projects,projects.name"
```

### Move Task to Section

Move tasks between board columns (e.g., "In Progress", "In Review"):

1. List sections in the project:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
     "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/<project-gid>/sections?opt_fields=name"
   ```

2. Find the target section by name, then move:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"data":{"task":"<task-gid>"}}' \
     "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/sections/<section-gid>/addTask"
   ```

### Update Custom Field

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"custom_fields":{"<field-gid>":"<value>"}}}' \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/<task-gid>"
```

For enum fields, the value is the enum option GID.

### Post Comment on Task

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"text":"<comment text>"}}' \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/<task-gid>/stories"
```

### Fetch Subtasks

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/<task-gid>/subtasks?opt_fields=name,completed,gid"
```

### Fetch Task Stories (Comments)

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/<task-gid>/stories?opt_fields=type,text,created_by.name,created_at"
```

Filter results for `type: "comment"` to get human-written comments.

## URL Formats and GID Extraction

Asana URLs come in several formats. The task GID is always a numeric segment:

- `https://app.asana.com/0/<project-gid>/<task-gid>`
- `https://app.asana.com/0/<project-gid>/<task-gid>/f`
- `https://app.asana.com/1/<org-gid>/project/<project-gid>/task/<task-gid>`
- `https://app.asana.com/1/<org-gid>/inbox/<inbox-gid>/item/<task-gid>/...`

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized** — If using a named override token (e.g., `ASANA_TOKEN_WORK`), follow the fallback logic in Token Resolution above. If using the default `$ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, guide the user to regenerate at https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps.
- **403 Forbidden** — User lacks access to the resource.
- **404 Not Found** — Invalid GID or deleted resource.
- **429 Rate Limited** — Back off and retry after the `Retry-After` header.

Never silently skip a failed API call. Report the status code and error message.
