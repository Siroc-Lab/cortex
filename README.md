## Plugins

### asana-workflow

End-to-end Asana-driven development workflow: from ticket to shipped PR with automated task tracking, git management, and team communication.

**Skills included:**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `start-task` | Validates Asana task, creates branch and draft PR, routes to feature-dev or debugging. Writes a per-step checkpoint for resumability; add `fast` to skip sub-skill routing |
| `ship-it` | Orchestrates pre-checks, summary, PR creation, and Asana update |
| `pre-ship-check` | Validates git state, lint, build, and tests |
| `git-check` | Branch safety, working tree cleanliness, debug artifact detection |
| `work-summary` | Session recap for standups, handoffs, and PRs |
| `create-pr` | Full PR lifecycle with Asana linking and reviewer assignment |
| `asana-api` | Asana REST API patterns and common operations |
| `log-task` | Creates an Asana task from work discovered or completed in conversation |
| `fix-bug` | Full bug-fix lifecycle orchestrator: root cause investigation, TDD hard gate, and ship |
| `mobile-qa` | Investigates and verifies bugs in iOS simulators and Android emulators via mobile-mcp |
| `web-qa` | Investigates and verifies bugs in running web applications via Chrome DevTools MCP |

## Installation

Run the setup script — it validates prerequisites, configures tokens, and guides you through plugin installation:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

### What the Script Does

**GitHub CLI** — Checks that `gh` is installed, authenticated, and has access to the private `Siroc-Lab/cortex` repo.

**Git SSH** — Tests SSH authentication to GitHub. If you use SSH keys, it offers to configure the HTTPS-to-SSH rewrite Claude Code needs:

```bash
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

**Asana token** — Looks for `ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your environment. If missing, prompts you to paste one (from https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps) and writes it to your profile.

**GitHub token** — Checks for `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` for marketplace auto-updates. Can extract one from `gh auth token` if not set.

**Plugin installation** — Once all prerequisites pass, prints the exact Claude Code commands to run:

1. `/plugin marketplace add Siroc-Lab/cortex`
2. `/plugin install asana-workflow@siroc-cortex`

> If the script added tokens to your shell profile, reload your terminal (`source ~/.zshrc`) before continuing.
